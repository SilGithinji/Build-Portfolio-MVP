This repository holds the maze project, made of a simple program that utilizes various data structures and algorithms to develop and tackle mazes.

Structure and outline

•	Maze Feature
o	Generate new layout "C"
o	Change Object player "P"
o	Change view "V" (2 Dimension, 3 Dimension, Fps)
o	Move the player Up:"W" | Down:"S" | Left:"A" | Right:"D"
o	Rotate maze -YAxis:"J" | -XAxis:"K" | XAxis:"I" | XAxis:"L" (Only In 3dimension)
o	Action For Key:	1,2,3,4,5
	Key 1:	Active/Deactive Ambient Light
	Key 2:	Active/Deactive Diffuse Light
	Key 3:	Active/Deactive Specular Light
	Key 4:	Change The Day (Background)
	Key 5:	Change Wall Transparant or Not
o	Change Maze size , "+" to Increase and "-" to Decrease
o	Arroy Key To Walk Inside Maze While in Fps Mode (ArrowKeyUP , ArrowKeyDOWN , ArrowKeyLEFT, ArrowKeyRIGHT)
o	Change Nim (ID) Rotation Using Mouse Click (Left,Center,Right)
o	Space to Run/Stop another one player.
Key components of the Directory:
o	README.md: This file contains the documentation for the project, including information on what the project does, how to use it, and how to contribute to it.
o	mains.cpp:	It is the main entry point of the program, where the execution of the program begins. It encompasses the initialization of variables and objects, the invocation of functions and methods, and the handling of errors and exceptions.
o	mains.h:	Contains the implementation and the header file for the Maze class. It generates a maze using the Kruskal's algorithm for minimum spanning trees. The class defines methods to retrieve the maze as a two-dimensional array of cells and to retrieve the positions of the entrance and exit doors.
o	transverse.h:	Contains the implementation and the header file for the Transversal class. The Transversal class finds a path from the entrance door to the exit door of the maze using a depth-first search algorithm. The class defines methods to retrieve the path as a two-dimensional array of cells and to check if a given position is part of the path.
o	images:	This directory contains any images or graphics used in the documentation.
o	main:		The file contains the executable binary generated by compiling the program.
Data Structures
•	Stacks:			The depth-first search algorithm used to solve the maze is implemented using a stack data structure.
•	Queues:		The breadth-first search algorithm used to solve the maze is implemented using a queue data structure.
•	Graphs.		The maze is represented as a graph, where each cell in the maze is a node in the graph and the edges represent the possible paths between the nodes.
•	Disjoint-sets:		The Kruskal algorithm which is used to discover the shortest path between two points in a connected weighted graph; used to generate a maze is implemented using the disjoint-set data structure.
Build
•	Linux/Ubuntu
o	You Can Use The Codeblock For Linux As Well.
o	You Can Execute Your Code Using A Text Editor That You Love. Like Atoms, Sublime,Geany Or Another.
Before Executing, You Must Install Some Dependency Of Glut On Linux. What You Need To Do Is (Installation Via Terminal):
o	Install The Compiler And Necessary Tools.A Fairly Complete Compiler You Can Use G++, How to :
sudo apt-get install g++ cmake 
o	Install Freeglut :
sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev
It provides a set of utilities for creating and managing windows, handling input from mouse and keyboard, and creating menus. It is designed to be platform-independent and compatible with multiple programming languages.
o	Run Using Terminal :
gcc -o excecutebin main.cpp -lglut -lGL -lm -lGLU -lstdc++
Program documentation
•	V-1.0
o	In This Version, The Object The Player Can Still Penetrate The Wall
o	Object Player Running (Right, Left, Bottom, Top) With Magnitude 0.1.
o	The Shape Of The Maze Randomed By Using Button C & Player Can Walk A = Left, S = Down, D = To, W = Up
o	Still 2 Dimensional Maze Form
•	V-2.0
o	Object cant penetrate the wall
o	Have two object player (cube and cone)
o	Have 2 different view, 2d and 3d
o	When 3dviewmode, maze can rotation by I,J,K,L
o	Nim rotation can change by mouse click (left,center,right)
o	Change maze size using "+" to increase and "-" to decrease
•	V-3.0
o	Have 3 different view, 2d, 3d, Fps
o	Can walk inside the maze using arrowKey when fps viewmode
o	Active / Deactive 3 Light usign 1,2,3 Key
o	Tranparant Wall usign the 5 Key
o	Day or Night usign the 4 key
o	Spaace to Run/Stop another one player.
